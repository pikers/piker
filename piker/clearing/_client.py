    Spawn an EMS daemon and begin sending orders and receiving

    This EMS tries to reduce most broker's terrible order entry apis to
    a very simple protocol built on a few easy to grok and/or
    "rantsy" premises:

    - most users will prefer "dark mode" where orders are not submitted
      to a broker until and execution condition is triggered
      (aka client-side "hidden orders")

    - Brokers over-complicate their apis and generally speaking hire
      poor designers to create them. We're better off using creating a super
      minimal, schema-simple, request-event-stream protocol to unify all the
      existing piles of shit (and shocker, it'll probably just end up
      looking like a decent crypto exchange's api)

    - all order types can be implemented with client-side limit orders

    - we aren't reinventing a wheel in this case since none of these
      brokers are exposing FIX protocol; it is they doing the re-invention.
