    order control on behalf of clients.

    This is the daemon (child) side routine which starts an EMS runtime
    (one per broker-feed) and and begins streaming back alerts from
    broker executions/fills.

    ``send_order_cmds()`` is called here to execute in a task back in
    the actor which started this service (spawned this actor), presuming
    capabilities allow it, such that requests for EMS executions are
    received in a stream from that client actor and then responses are
    streamed back up to the original calling task in the same client.

    The primary ``emsd`` task tree is:

    - ``_emsd_main()``:
      sets up brokerd feed, order feed with ems client, trades dialogue with
      brokderd trading api.
       |
        - ``clear_dark_triggers()``:
          run (dark order) conditions on inputs and trigger brokerd "live"
          order submissions.
       |
        - (maybe) ``translate_and_relay_brokerd_events()``:
          accept normalized trades responses from brokerd, process and
          relay to ems client(s); this is a effectively a "trade event
          reponse" proxy-broker.
       |
        - ``process_client_order_cmds()``:
          accepts order cmds from requesting piker clients, registers
          execs with exec loop
