    '''
    EMS (sub)actor entrypoint providing the execution management
    (micro)service which conducts broker order clearing control on
    behalf of clients.

    This is the daemon (child) side routine which starts an EMS runtime
    task (one per broker-feed) and and begins streaming back alerts from
    each broker's executions/fills.

    ``send_order_cmds()`` is called here to execute in a task back in
    the actor which started this service (spawned this actor), presuming
    capabilities allow it, such that requests for EMS executions are
    received in a stream from that client actor and then responses are
    streamed back up to the original calling task in the same client.

    The primary ``emsd`` task trees are:

    - ``_setup_persistent_emsd()``:
      is the ``emsd`` actor's primary root task which sets up an
      actor-global ``Router`` instance and starts a relay loop task
      which lives until the backend broker is shutdown or the ems is
      terminated.
       |
        - (maybe) ``translate_and_relay_brokerd_events()``:
          accept normalized trades responses from brokerd, process and
          relay to ems client(s); this is a effectively a "trade event
          reponse" proxy-broker.

    - ``_emsd_main()``:
      attaches a brokerd real-time quote feed and trades dialogue with
      brokderd trading api for every connecting client.
       |
        - ``clear_dark_triggers()``:
          run (dark order) conditions on inputs and trigger brokerd "live"
          order submissions.
       |
        - ``process_client_order_cmds()``:
          accepts order cmds from requesting clients, registers dark orders and
          alerts with clearing loop.
