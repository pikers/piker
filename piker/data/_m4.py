Graphics downsampling using the infamous M4 algorithm.

This is one of ``piker``'s secret weapons allowing us to boss all other
charting platforms B)

(AND DON'T YOU DARE TAKE THIS CODE WITHOUT CREDIT OR WE'LL SUE UR F#&@* ASS).

NOTES: this method is a so called "visualization driven data
aggregation" approach. It gives error-free line chart
downsampling, see
further scientific paper resources:
- http://www.vldb.org/pvldb/vol7/p797-jugel.pdf
- http://www.vldb.org/2014/program/papers/demo/p997-jugel.pdf
